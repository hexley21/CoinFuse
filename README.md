### Built With

The CoinFuse app follows a modular architecture that promotes separation of concerns and modularity. It consists of the following modules, each responsible for specific functionality:

- **App Module**: The main module of the app that encompasses the UI elements and user interface-related functionalities. It utilizes the following Android Architecture Components:
  - LiveData: Used for data observation and propagation between the view-models and UI components.
  - Data Binding: Binds UI components in layouts to data sources, simplifying UI updates.

- **Presentation Module**: This module contains the view-models responsible for orchestrating the interaction between the UI components and the domain layer. It utilizes LiveData for reactive data updates.
  - ViewModel: Stores and manages UI-related data, ensuring data survives configuration changes.

- **Domain Module**: Encapsulates the core business logic and use cases of the app. It defines interfaces and contracts that the data layer must implement.

- **Data Module**: Implements the repositories defined in the domain module and acts as a bridge between the domain and the external data sources. It incorporates the following Android Architecture Components:
  - Room: Handles local database caching and retrieval.

- **Remote Module**: Handles data retrieval from external APIs and utilizes Retrofit for network communication.

- **Local Module**: An Android-specific module that focuses on storing and accessing data locally. It includes Room for local database caching and Shared Preferences for managing application preferences.

By following this modular architecture, the CoinFuse app achieves a clean separation of concerns, promotes code reusability, and facilitates easy maintenance and testing. The app also incorporates several Android Architecture Components, such as LiveData, ViewModel, Data Binding, and Room, to enhance its functionality and provide a smooth user experience.
